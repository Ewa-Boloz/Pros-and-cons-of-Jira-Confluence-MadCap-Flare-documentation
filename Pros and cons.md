# Jira and Confluence
## Pros

### Quickstart menu
* A great point to start, if you are new to the tool.  
* It opens automatically once you enter the page for the first time and offers a start tour.  
* It is always accessible under the **Quick start** icon. ![3](3.png)

### Easy access to documentation and on-line courses

* Help panel is available under the **question mark** button at the top-right corner. 
* **Search bar** is on the top - we can start looking for an answer without going through all the documentation.
* In Jira view you will see a couple of useful articles on the top.
* Below there are links to [online courses](https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/871316), documentation in [online help center](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/resources/) form and [community help](https://community.atlassian.com/?tempId=eyJvaWRjX2NvbnNlbnRfbGFuZ3VhZ2VfdmVyc2lvbiI6IjIuMCIsIm9pZGNfY29uc2VudF9ncmFudGVkX2F0IjoxNjM3MjUxODU1NzE2fQ==) where you can ask questions and discuss with other Atlassian users.

### Clear structure and well organized content

  * all content is grouped in [few main sections](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/resources/)
  * each setion contain links to the more detailed articles
  * artciles are write in simple language

## Cons

### A lot of knowledge

* There are many different sources of knowledge: quick start, on-line courses (atlassian university), help articles, community. It is hard to choose what to read first - probably a new user will read almost nothing and experiment on his own.
* Atlassian university which contains many useful videos and courses both for jira and confluence users can be open only from jira view.
